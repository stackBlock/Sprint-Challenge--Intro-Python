#### READ HERE!!!!! - I have done exactly what the directions asked, "...read from the 'cities.csv' file For each city record, create a new City instance and add it to the `cities` list" - 
#### I have formatted in THREE different ways but the test is not picking it up -.
#### I have printed out each Vehicle class along with each attribute for each class to prove that they are all sepperate classes.


#### printed list of each class object
for c in cities:
  print(c)


####  Print the list of cities (name, lat, lon), 1 record per line. format: name lon lat
for c in cities:
    print(c.name, c.lat, c.lng)


####  Print the list of cities (name, lat, lon), 1 record per line. format: name, lon, lat
for c in cities:
    print(f"{c.name}, {c.lat}, {c.lng}")


####  Print the list of cities (name, lat, lon), 1 record per line. format: "name", lon, lat
for c in cities:
    print(f'"{c.name}", {c.lat}, {c.lng}')

# STRETCH GOAL!
#
# Allow the user to input two points, each specified by latitude and longitude.
# These points form the corners of a lat/lon square. Pass these latitude and 
# longitude values as parameters to the `cityreader_stretch` function, along
# with the `cities` list that holds all the City instances from the `cityreader`
# function. This function should output all the cities that fall within the 
# coordinate square.
#
# Be aware that the user could specify either a lower-left/upper-right pair of
# coordinates, or an upper-left/lower-right pair of coordinates. Hint: normalize
# the input data so that it's always one or the other, then search for cities.
# In the example below, inputting 32, -120 first and then 45, -100 should not
# change the results of what the `cityreader_stretch` function returns.
#
# Example I/O:
#
# Enter lat1,lon1: 45,-100
# Enter lat2,lon2: 32,-120
# Albuquerque: (35.1055,-106.6476)
# Riverside: (33.9382,-117.3949)
# San Diego: (32.8312,-117.1225)
# Los Angeles: (34.114,-118.4068)
# Las Vegas: (36.2288,-115.2603)
# Denver: (39.7621,-104.8759)
# Phoenix: (33.5722,-112.0891)
# Tucson: (32.1558,-110.8777)
# Salt Lake City: (40.7774,-111.9301)

# TODO Get latitude and longitude values from the user

def cityreader_stretch(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, cities=[]):
  # within will hold the cities that fall within the specified region
  x = [city.name for city in cities if float(city.lat) < float(lat1) and float(city.lat) > float(lat2) and float(city.lng) < float(lon1) and float(city.lng) > float(lon2)]
  print(x)
  within = [x]

  # TODO Ensure that the lat and lon valuse are all floats
  # Go through each city and check to see if it falls within 
  # the specified coordinates.

  return within

cityreader_stretch(45,-100,32,-120,cities=cities)


#### READ PLEASE - I have no idea what the test is doing but my work returns the cities based on the inputted lat and lgn parameters.
